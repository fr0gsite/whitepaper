## Technical Architecture

Fr0g.site's technical foundation combines several proven decentralized technologies to create a robust, scalable media platform. Understanding these core technologies is essential to appreciating the platform's capabilities and advantages.

### 4.1 EOS Blockchain

The EOS blockchain serves as the backbone of Fr0g.site, providing fast, scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications (DApps). EOS was chosen for its superior performance characteristics and developer-friendly features.

#### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
EOS utilizes a Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that enables:
- **High Transaction Throughput**: Capable of processing thousands of transactions per second
- **Low Latency**: Near-instantaneous transaction confirmation
- **Energy Efficiency**: Significantly lower energy consumption than Proof of Work systems

#### Block Producer System
The network is secured and operated by 21 Block Producers:
- **20 Elected Producers**: Chosen through continuous community voting
- **1 Standby Producer**: Randomly selected to prevent centralization
- **Democratic Selection**: Token holders vote for their preferred Block Producers
- **Accountability**: Poor performance results in removal through voting

#### Resource Management
EOS implements a sophisticated resource allocation system:

**CPU Resources**: Computational power for executing smart contracts
- Allocated through token staking
- Automatically replenished after 3 days
- Prevents spam while maintaining accessibility

**NET Resources**: Network bandwidth for data transmission
- Similar staking mechanism to CPU
- Ensures network stability under high load

**RAM**: Persistent storage within the blockchain
- Purchased rather than staked
- Limited resource that maintains its value
- Stores all metadata permanently

#### Key Advantages for Fr0g.site

**Fee-less Transactions**: Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, EOS transactions don't require gas fees, making microtransactions economically viable.

**Upgrade Flexibility**: The EOSIO Upgrade Proposal (EUP) system allows network improvements without hard forks.

**Scalability**: High transaction throughput supports a large user base without performance degradation.

**Interoperability**: Native support for cross-chain communication and token exchanges.

<!-- TODO: Add performance benchmarks and scalability testing results -->
<!-- TODO: Add comparison with other blockchain platforms (Ethereum, Solana, etc.) -->

<!-- TODO: Add gas cost estimates and optimization strategies -->

### 4.3 IPFS Network

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) provides decentralized storage for all media content on Fr0g.site, ensuring permanent availability and censorship resistance.

#### How IPFS Works

**Content Addressing**: Files are identified by cryptographic hashes of their content rather than location-based URLs
- Hash uniquely identifies content
- Identical files always have the same hash
- Any modification creates a new hash

**Distributed Storage**: Content is distributed across multiple network nodes
- Files split into encrypted blocks
- Blocks stored on various peer computers
- Redundancy ensures availability even if some nodes go offline

**Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Direct file sharing between network participants
- No central servers required
- Faster downloads from nearby peers
- Natural load distribution

#### Advantages Over Traditional Storage

**Censorship Resistance**: No single point of control means content cannot be easily removed
**Permanent Availability**: Content remains accessible as long as any peer stores it
**Bandwidth Efficiency**: Popular content is cached closer to users, reducing load times
**Cost Effectiveness**: Eliminates expensive centralized storage infrastructure

**Global Accessibility**: Content accessible from anywhere in the world

### 4.4 IPFS Gateway

IPFS Gateways serve as bridges between the decentralized IPFS network and the traditional web, making content accessible through standard HTTP protocols.

#### Gateway Functions

**Protocol Translation**: Converts IPFS addresses to HTTP URLs
**Content Retrieval**: Fetches files from the IPFS network on behalf of clients
**Caching**: Stores frequently accessed content for faster delivery
**Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple IPFS nodes

#### Decentralization Benefits

Multiple gateway operators can serve the same content, preventing single points of failure and ensuring users always have access to their media, even if some gateways become unavailable.

## Governance & Content Moderation

Fr0g.site implements a sophisticated community governance system that balances free expression with quality content standards through decentralized moderation.

### 7.1 Truster System

Trusters are elected community members responsible for reviewing reported content and maintaining platform quality standards. This system ensures democratic content moderation without centralized control.

#### Truster Selection

**Limited Positions**: Maximum of 200 Trusters at any time to maintain quality and accountability
**Democratic Selection**: Random selection from applicant pool when positions are available
**Application Process**: 
- Requires security deposit
- 30-day waiting period for new accounts

#### Karma System

Trusters maintain a reputation score that determines their standing and continued eligibility:

**Starting Karma**: 500 points for all new Trusters
**Maximum Karma**: 600 points
**Minimum Threshold**: Below 1 point results in permanent disqualification

**Karma Adjustments**:
- **Correct Decisions**: +karma (aligned with majority vote)
- **Incorrect Decisions**: -karma (opposed to majority vote)
- **Missed Deadlines**: -100 karma for failing to vote within 22 hours
- **Timely Participation**: +50 karma for votes within deadline

#### Compensation Structure

Trusters receive TRUST tokens for their moderation work, convertible to system tokens:

| Time to Vote (Hours) | Reward (TRUST Tokens) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| < 12 | 100% of allocated reward |
| 12-16 | 75% of allocated reward |
| 16-19 | 50% of allocated reward |
| 19-22 | 25% of allocated reward |
| 22-23 | 0% for selected Trusters, 50% for any Truster |
| 23-24 | 0% for selected Trusters, 75% for any Truster |

### 7.2 Reporting Mechanism

The platform's content moderation relies on community reporting and democratic review rather than automated censorship.

#### Reporting Process

1. **Content Flagging**: Any user can report content they believe violates platform rules
2. **Truster Assignment**: System selects 7 random Trusters (always odd number for decisive voting)
3. **Review Period**: Trusters have 22 hours to evaluate and vote on reported content
4. **Decision**: Majority vote determines outcome (keep/remove content)
5. **Enforcement**: Sanctions applied automatically based on Truster decision

#### Fallback Mechanisms

**Insufficient Trusters**: If 7 Trusters unavailable, smaller odd-numbered group selected
**No Available Trusters**: Content remains unless community volunteers step forward
**Delayed Decisions**: After 24 hours with incomplete votes, content is automatically removed

#### Appeals Process

**Transparent Voting**: All votes and reasoning should be visible to community (technical limitations may require compromise)
**Community Oversight**: Truster decisions subject to community review and karma adjustments

### 7.3 Community Rules

Platform rules are categorized by severity to ensure proportionate responses to violations.

#### Serious Violations
Result in immediate and permanent account suspension:
- [Specific rules to be defined in governance process]
- [Focus on illegal content, harassment, threats]

#### Moderate Violations  
Result in warnings and temporary restrictions:
- [Specific rules to be defined in governance process]
- [Multiple violations lead to escalating penalties]
- [Three moderate violations result in permanent suspension]

#### Governance Principles

**Free Expression**: Platform allows all words and expressions within legal boundaries
**Community Standards**: Rules developed through democratic governance process
**Transparency**: All moderation decisions and rules are publicly documented
**Proportional Response**: Penalties match the severity of violations

**Rule Development**: Community governance process will establish specific rule categories and enforcement guidelines through token-weighted voting.
